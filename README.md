RISC-V bus based architecture CPU with R-type,I-type, S-type, J-type,and B-type instructions added with its microcontroller to perform microprogramming for instructions
NOTE:The whole project is built entirely on Modelsim, so it's preferable to run it on Modelsim or just copy the RTLs and put them on different simulators. Also, for each component in the CPU there is a testbench for example register file has register file testbench and alu has alu testbench etc.....
