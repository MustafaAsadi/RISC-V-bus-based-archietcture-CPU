RISC-V bus based archietcture CPU with R-type,I-type, S-type, J-type,and B-type instructions added with it a microcontroller to perform microprogramming for instructions
NOTE:The whole project is builts entirly on modelsim so its preferable to run it on modelsim or just copy the RTLs and put them on diffrent simulator
